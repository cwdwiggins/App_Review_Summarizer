It is absolutely INFURIATING that I cannot read yelp reviews in a browser!  Ridiculous that I need to have the yelp app installed on my phone to access reviews. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve installed, and used the yelp app numerous times on multiple devices and it’s always one of the first apps I uninstall when I need to clean up a device as it serves exactly no purpose. When attempting to review a review in yelp, it’s not possible without the app. Whether I’m using google or chrome or safari, it doesn’t matter, it’s impossible to read a single review in its entirety. Which is beyond dumb! However, when I’m automatically bumped into the App Store as a means to bully and force me into installing the yelp app once again, I remember that yelp itself is a scam and the epitome of a dishonest, manipulative and, shady business!! Which is the only thing about yelp that I appreciate!! Why, because I instantly see one star review after 1 star review, from the endless array of us that are over the questionable business tactics that is the basis of yelp’s shady business model.

Yelp deleted 3 of my accounts because they would not let me write my review due to the business owner being upset. If I’m not able to be honest about good and bad experiences then what’s the point? Customer service did nothing to help the problem and all of the positive reviews I had wrote for small businesses were also deleted with my accounts. Such a shame. I thought as an app that is centered around honest reviews, they would uphold their end of allowing them, but no, they will side with businesses and delete your Yelp account for using the app as it was intended. Absolutely disgusting. I have moved onto other apps/platforms that respect their user’s honesty and do not punish them for reviews. If a business scams people out of their money, I believe it’s my responsibility to inform people through a public review, so that someone else isn’t a victim to it, but Yelp does not believe in keeping businesses honest.

One of my favorite features is the search filter. I can narrow down options based on location, price, and even specific amenities, which saves a lot of time. Plus, the photos uploaded by users give an honest look at what to expect, especially for restaurants.

I also love the ability to bookmark places. When friends recommend spots or I find something that looks interesting, I can save it for later. It’s been a lifesaver when I’m out and need a last-minute recommendation!

I recently brought a Yelp review to Yelp’s attention because it was from someone who in their own review admitted they hadn’t played a game offered by the Escape Room company. The problem is that the lady strictly based her review on how she imagined the game would be and not on her true experience. When I submitted this to yelp they responded that she was giving her person experience. But how? She never played the game.

A couple of suggestions.

I like that people can check in. 
It would make more sense if there was an option to geographically base the check ins.  Say for example you go a business trip and there was an awesome restaurant you visited but couldn't remember what the name was or where it was located. While you remembered to check in, it was roughly about 3 years ago. You have to spend several minutes scrolling and scrolling through your saved check ins to find the general timeframe of when you went there. More often than not, I will skip over it and it just leads to frustration.  

Make check ins more useful. The same repetitive questions keep coming up. For attire, answering either casual or formal would generally suffice.  I don't think people filter places specifically looking for a divvy or hipster venue.  I think one of the more useful things you could add is average wait time and harness the database of loyal users. If you could ask if wait time is less than 5 min, less than 30 min, or greater than an hour for walk ins, that would help users prioritize their list of possible selections.  

Hope these suggestions make it to the next update.",3,False,Ric M.,Good but could use improvements,"{'id': 7107553, 'body': ""Hello, thanks for taking the time to review Yelp.

As with most tournaments, we did not know if we’d be playing in the am wave or pm wave until a few days prior.  Cameo Pizza said no problem, we got you.

Finally got our times, they held our spots, we showed up and they sat us all together.  Parents and coaches at two high top tables, kids right beneath us but all together.  When it cane time to order, server suggested we order by our kid’s uniform number.  Easy peasy!

Ordered quickly, drinks were served, food delivered, beers and sodas refilled. Leftovers boxed, to go orders filled, charges broken out by jersey number, bills paid and then off for ice cream (Tofts).

What a pleasant experience!  In a situation where 1,000 things could go awry, nothing did.  Thank you Cameo on West Monroe; you far outdid our expectations!  We will be back next year!  Or maybe even sooner for a Cedar Point trip!

One Thai restaurant on third ave in Manhattan was the best. The restaurant was so good that on my day off I took my daughter from Suffolk to try it  . She loved it . Since then I was transferred out east. We had a base dish to compare it to and that was ‘BASIL BEEF WITH TOM YUM SOUP’. We tried months and no restaurant could compare.

The Yelp app does not seem to have to ability to access any folders in my camera roll. I often store the photos I would like to use for the review in my “favorites” folder so I can post the exact photo of my choice. My most recent effort to post a review has resulted in multiple crashes of the app and the inability to remove photos I have incorrectly chosen from my camera roll. These drawbacks make me less inclined to post reviews. I hope there is a way for Yelp to cure this issue because I believe Yelp is a valuable tool for people who enjoy eating out.

I wanted to write a couple of reviews, but since we had moved on to the next city, the app would not find the businesses I wanted to review. Second, Yelp sells advertising. This means that they have the ability to push businesses that buy advertising up above those who do not...similar to what the better business bureau does.

Firstly, we were a group of four that had never been there. We went to a movie and walked over because it was close.
We were seated and it was a normal sports bar/restaurant style. Three different menus.
We order drinks and my husband who specifically asked for a NA beer was told it was on draft. We questioned this as that is not the norm. He is in recovery for three years now. He was served an alcohol beer and charged full price even though he sent it back after one sip. How awful! Would you serve a person who was allergic to shellfish shrimp and act so nonchalant? First strike.
Second strike was when we ordered wings: the chalkboard said all apps were 30% on Sunday.
We received the bill and that price was not honored. We inquired and were told that had we chosen to order from “the other side of the menu” that would have been true. Again, no care or concern for guest happiness .

We typically remove reviews that describe individuals or situations with objectionable terms that go beyond simply reviewing a customer experience with a business. We ask that reviewers avoid commentary that reinforces negative cultural stereotypes, makes light of physical or sexual violence, or otherwise includes unnecessarily graphic or offensive descriptions.

The red Sangria was excellent and the beer and wine menu is surprisingly broad and varied. 
The menu seems to change often with a few exceptions. We all had the large plates. Mine was grouper and mushrooms on an eggplant slice. Very nicely prepared and presented. My wife had the goat cheese chicken, which she loved and my son had shrimp and grits which was equally well received. 
The portions were generous and we all took something home. 
But we had to try the desserts and they were fantastic. 
Maybe a little pricey for Tallahassee but worth the money in every regard. I’ve had much worse for much more.

Forced to update yelp after it repeatedly crashed after updating iOS.  Yelp changed the layout, and now you see either the map or the search results list taking most of the screen, but no more list of restaurants side by side to a map area.  Switching between landscape and portrait mode changes nothing.  You can move the slider bar--but as soon as you press anywhere in either area, that section goes back to taking up most of the screen.  So, the slider bar isn't very useful because it doesn't stay put.

If you're researching restaurants in a map area, do it in Google Maps first.  In Google maps, type in restaurants, <city> in their search bar, then move/zoom the map to a specific area, then press (search this area). You'll see the list of different restaurants in that map area, side by side next to a map. Select a restaurant and scroll to see reviews.

Yelp is the most annoying and disrespectful company I have ever dealt with. Yelps does not respect when a business asks for you to stop calling. If I hang up the person calls back. I have had people be rude, raise their voice, and argue with me when I simply do not want their ad service and do not wish for people to continue calling. Now when I don’t answer yelp calls they Facebook stalk me and proceed to email me. From a business owner and consumer standpoint yelp is a joke. It is where uneducated and ingnorat people go to write rediculous and often over dramatized bad reviews for companies. Then businesses who do not pay for their services have no way of dealing with it. If I am looking for a business other than my own I never look at what yelp has to offer because I know that 99% of the information found on yelp is irrelevant. 

Yelp claims they do not pay people that leave reviews which I know is completely false because I have several customers who have told me they get paid to leave reviews.

Part of the manicure is that they applied some sort of conditioner and let it sit on the nails. While mine was sitting she worked on my daughters. It must have sat too long because my nails began burning. She sprayed water on them and let it sit longer until I couldn’t handle it any longer. She then wiped it all off, and continued the manicure.
The manicure was so brutal and hard that an open wound on my cuticle (very visible) began gushing blood due to her insensitivity.
My daughter also had 3 bloody cuticles when she was done.
It wasn’t even 2 hours post manicure that the gel started chipping and separating from my nails. Not to mention the pain and sensitivity that I couldn’t pin point. 
THATS NOT EVEN THE WORST PART
It wasn’t until the gel, that had already separated, came off that I realized why my nail hurt so much - because there are holes in them. You can see that whatever they put on there ate away at my nails.

Clean Juice is completely Certified Organic and they have to be reviewed yearly to keep this status That means that all products are made with 100% organic fruits and vegetables, unlike Nektor or pressed Juice or Jumba Juice.  

I have been going to the Clean Juice store since they opened and have never gotten anything that I did not love.  All of the staff that I have encountered have been friendly and very courteous.

With all the built-in sensors and processing power on today’s modern smart phones (many time what Apollo 11 had available, e.g.), there must be someway to know if someone has actually been at that business location and used it’s services or products.

How about offering a million dollar “X Prize” type award for someone who could register a successful solution with Yelp? Yelp should be able to implement each probable candidate, which a user could then volunteer to use, instead of the “standard” Yelp.

In the latest version of this app, when location services are enabled, the More button (see attached photo on Twitter), that is supposed to be listed as the last icon in the group of icons near the top of the display, in the Nearby Area, is not showing.  Unlike the More tab, located at the bottom of the display, the button in question allows the user to see a complete list of various categories from which to choose.

With location services enabled, I have been able to get the More icon to be displayed on my iPhone 7 Plus (Verizon Wireless).  However, I cannot get it to be displayed on my 6 Plus (Verizon Wireless), my 6 S Plus (Sprint), or my 8 Plus (AT&T Wireless) phones.  All of my devices are running iOS 11.3.

Currently, the only way I can get the More icon to be consistently displayed is to uninstall the app from my phone, reboot the phone, reinstall the app, and electing to not allow location services.  Then, and only then, does the More iCon appear in its expected location.  The problem is that as soon as I enable location services, the icon disappears.

This is an extremely annoying bug that I hope will be resolved as soon as possible.

I was going to write a detailed description, but there isn’t enough time or space. So here is a list of what went wrong…
1. No spa chairs with foot basins that can be filled. The water had to be brought in by the jug full.
2. It took the person doing the service 15 minutes just to remove the polish on my daughters toes. 
3. The person looked at my feet and said, “Oh, you have tiny nails, it’s going to be hard to work on your feet”.
4.  When the person started to remove my polish, she couldn’t get it off, she soaked my toes in remover, tried using the drill, nicked my skin and cuticles on both feet, then put straight acetone on my nails to try to soak it off. She tried to file it. I’ve had pedicures many times in the past and have never had problems. 
5. When the person clipped and filed both our toe nails, she would make a clip and then try to pick the nail off with her fingers.  She actually left one of my toes raggedy.

DO NOT HIRE THIS COMPANY!  
They claim to be Professional Movers but trust me...they are NOT!  
I used All American Van Lines based in Farmingdale NY specifically because they stated they were professional Piano Movers.  And of course I was charged extra to move the Piano.  
When I unwrapped my beautiful white Baby Grand Piano I was heartbroken to observe that it had extensive damage.
Arel the Manager offered to reimburse me $100, even though the repair cost $450.  But he wanted me to sign and notarize a Form that forbids the Customer from writing a Review!
That’s unethical and goes against every American’s right to Freedom of Speech.
All American Van Lines thinks they can shield themselves from poor Reviews by bribing their Customers for $100???   Not this Customer!!
I experienced multiple problems with All American.
Both my Bedroom sets were assembled incorrectly and they had to send a Team to rectify the mistakes.
They damaged and chipped pieces of my furniture.
They ran out of proper moving supplies and wrapped my good Dining Room Chairs in dirty moving blankets.  They chipped paint off the newly painted walls.  They took hours longer than required because they were Bunglers -  far from professional movers!

A. Reviews need to be semi-anonymous (which Yelp enforces by excluding the last name, showing a minimal pic of the person, and allowing some bio details at the consumer’s preference)

B. Businesses need the opportunity to respond to both positive and negative reviews, and have the opportunity to resolve any negative issues (some business owners/managers have routinely attempted to resolve issues—which offers a great deal of comfort to the consumer)

Yelp also has a relatively objective way of grading the legitimacy of the reviewer via the Elite rating assigned, number of friends and number of reviews.

Blooming Onion came out pretty quickly and was hot and delicious.  Took quite awhile for the soup to appear. Looked good. However, the mozzarella cheese was so thick we needed a knife to cut it. The bread took up the rest of the crock. Very little ( bland) broth and NO ONIONS!!    And no onion flavor. Very disappointed. We literally left a half bowl of soggy bread and inedible cheese there.

However: when you state ""we left the iron on too long"", you're basically admitting that flat design is a mistake. Please don't further the fad of awfulness by adopting it yourselves. 

Flat design is lazy, cheap, and ugly, and it's even uncomfortable to look at. Stop doing it! There are decades of design research that inform us of how best to do things. Don't ignore it! The flat fad is an ignorant abomination.",4,False,dysamoria,I generally favor this app... [updated],

Also, wouldn’t it be wiser to book with opentable or Resy vs booking with yelp. Seems like an unnecessary addition where we’ve already got good apps for this. I’d certainly be happier if OT or Resy popped up instead of yelp. Stick to locating and rating the local stuff, let us use the big players like OT and Resy. Stick to what you do best.

After several weeks of following up he has still never called. 

Be warned that this dealership is pushing big repairs and apparently lacks skills. I had to rate them with 1 star as that’s as low as it allows you to rate but I would rate them negative 5 star if I could.

It’s kind of a waste of time to spend time writing a thoughtful review if it ends up not being used.

I know that if you have a lot of reviews and friends and positive reviews, you are more likely to have your review posted and kept.  Usually, your review will be posted.  It is only later that you go back and check, that you find it has been taken down.

This skews the reviews.  Of course if you write 10 negative reviews for one business in one day under different names, I could see the problem, but what if you write one negative review and the business is allowed to ask 100 friends and family members to write good review the next week?

People, you need to recognize the fact that yelp is a moneymaking machine, and they manipulate everything to their advantage.  I no longer write reviews. Too many silly people offering opinions. They don’t have anything to do with food or atmosphere.

Never, never order anything online from a restaurant using Yelp. They take up to 33% of the proceeds from your order. That’s why restaurants go out of business. Restaurants feel they have to be on yelp and have to put their menus there because Yelp forces them to do so in order to elevate them on the reviews.

Yes, that is one of the widely known secrets about yelp. It is a pay to play platform. If a restaurant advertises, and places their menu on yelp for ordering, they go to the very top of the list and the best reviews are placed at the top and the ones star reviews are hidden.

 I recently made up my mind to buy a organic vitamin D air bottle on wish. It says that it will help me breathe, and I have been having trouble breathing for around 3 years now. The package arrived in 2 days like it said, but the moment I opened the can, the air disappointingly spilled all over my Supreme shirt. I contacted the manager to explain my issue and find out if they could send a replacement, but the only person that picked up was the man’s grandmother, who proceeded to persuade me to buy her homemade toothpaste. She seemed really sad when I said no, so I regretfully spent $250 on a gallon of the stuff. After one week of brushing my teeth with the brown paste, I began to occasionally start aggressively vomiting. I put the can in my cabinet and the vomiting got better, but overnight my dog snuck into my bathroom and opened the cabinet. He ate the entire tub of toothpaste and developed a stomach tumor. I paid 9,000 dollars for his hospital bills, but alas, he passed away. I cannot forget what this air has done to me. I am 20,000 dollars in debt and living in peoples walls.

Clean-up was very thorough - no signs of nails or any debris from the removal of the old roof.  I was quite impressed! 

Six hours after arriving, your trucks pulled away as if work had never been done, except for the look of the pristine great new roof left behind.

I've noticed with Yelp reviews, they don't post them all. THEY decide which ones are relevant through an algorithm. Having more reviews viewable gives the customer much better insight into the business compared to only letting the ones Yelp deems valuable be seen. 

If I post a review I would like it seen just to know that it may help someone. If it isn't going to be seen, why post a review? Yelp's customers aren't being heard. 

They also don't allow businesses to reply to feedback, good or bad. I know of a specific case where a person lied about a business situation and gave the business a 1 star but the business was not able to reply and give their side of the story so now everyone who reads that review takes it as truth.

Yelp’s algorithm frequently promotes negative reviews, making it challenging for businesses to maintain a fair online presence. Moreover, the lack of transparency in how reviews are filtered and displayed raises concerns about the platform’s integrity.

Attempts to resolve issues through Yelp’s support system are often met with minimal assistance, leaving business owners feeling unheard and powerless. The platform’s approach seems more geared towards pushing paid advertising rather than providing genuine support for businesses trying to manage their online reputation.
